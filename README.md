# Python Crash Course
---
I'm learning Python progamming basics from with my Brother and Dad from the [Python Crash Course](https://www.amazon.com.au/Python-Crash-Course-Eric-Matthes/dp/1718502702) book. Then we will use Python to program LEGO Edu Spike robots.

We will be commiting all of our programs from the book in this repository.
